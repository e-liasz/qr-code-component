## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

As I am a mere beginner, having done one simple course on HTML and CSS before, I have been learning quite a lot from watching other people's videos and solutions on different projects, but I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and challenge myself by starting this journey myself.
I learned the ropes of how to grasp responsiveness properly, how to use custom properties efficiently and some basics of positioning in CSS (that I know I will struggle with still for a long time). This was a great first project to make, as it didn't take too long to do and was
perfect for a beginner in the front-end dev scene.

### Continued development

I will be developing all the skills I mentioned previously, as well as be more curious about how to do things in a different manner; whether there are different solutions and what they are in every project I do.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's whole YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - This man is amazing at what he does and he explains things incredibly well to boot with.
- [Andreas Remdt's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANOz2JJqcgc) - This video on the project helped me out a lot when I was stuck on how to center the component.
